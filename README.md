# AI Code Reviewer

AI Code Reviewer is a Python script that leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to automatically review code changes in GitLab repositories. It listens for push events, fetches the associated code changes, and provides feedback on the changes in a Markdown format.

## Features

- Automatically reviews code changes in GitLab repositories
- Provides feedback on code clarity, simplicity, bugs, and security issues
- Generates Markdown-formatted responses for easy readability in GitLab

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (optional)
- An OpenAI API key
- A GitLab API token

cd OpenAI-Gitlab-PR-Review
```

2. Install the required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file and set the required environment variables:
```
